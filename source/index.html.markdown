## _From the Craft to the Cutting-Edge_

The **Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Course** provides an immersive, eight-week training seminar to students interested in digital and print publishing, with an emphasis on real-world experience. Students learn from a broad selection of experts in every aspect of digital and print publishing, including line editing and illustration to layout, coding, and graphic design. 

At a time when print publishing is as relevant today as ever, students intent on becoming editors, copyeditors, art directors, graphic designers, and publishers need to master the skills of both the print and digital arts. The Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Course gives students the opportunity to train in both digital and print publishing, in order to connect the two arts in a single, holistic training seminar that equips them with skills grounded in both crafts.

All seminar leaders specialize in a different aspect of the magazine industry; guest speakers include authors, journalists, publishing experts, art directors, and more.

## Real-World Publishing

What distinguishes the Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Course from more traditional publishing seminars is a signal focus on real-world publishing — and not just through lectures, homework assignments, or proposals. The Course doubles as both a training seminar and an incubator for producing real, live magazines, both digital and print, by the summer’s end. Students spend the summer developing their own vision for editing an independent magazine, training in the tools and skillsets necessary for ultimately launching either a print or a digital magazine of their own — which they will by the end of the Course. 

During the summer, students break off into separate cohorts each of which is challenged to launch a digital magazine by the end of the program. Each digital magazine they create stands as an independent online publication that students can continue running after the Course has concluded, or let stand as a product of their training during the Course. 

Meanwhile, all students participate in staffing and co-publishing the annual Course print edition, _The Dyad_, which features selections from each cohort’s digital magazine, in addition to other original content students acquire, curate, and edit specifically for the publication. _The Dyad_ is a Los Angeles Review of Books Channel magazine that LARB publishes both in print and online specifically for the Publishing Course. The print edition of the magazine is shipped to LARB Members and distributed to bookstores nationwide. 


Ultimately by the end of the Course, students will have produced a series of live digital magazines and a nationally distributed print edition that reflects their newfound expertise in the art of both digital and print publishing — making the Los Angeles Review of Books / USC Publishing Course a one-of-a-kind, vanguard real-world program whose graduates will be some of the most well-trained, experienced, competitive in the industry. 

## Industry Experts

The Publishing Course includes guest speakers covering all aspects of digital and print publishing — industry leaders including editors, literary agents, marketing professionals, published novelists, academic publishers, web coders and developers. 

Topics covered during the series include:

- How to edit short-form and long-form feature articles for a major magazine.
- The art of copyediting.
- How to be a part of and help run a new literary and cultural arts magazine, both in print and online.
- The editor-writer relationship.
- The state of independent publishing today.
- Publicity, marketing, SEO, and social media.
- How to write for and get published in a magazine.
- The art of print publishing: Color and dot correction, typeset, graphic design, print mechanics, and working with ink on paper.

## Career Placement

During the summer, students are paired with supervisors to help them determine their career preferences as they train in different aspects of the industry. Student assignments include developing a resume based on their particular interests, which they develop and workshop with their supervisors. By the end of the summer, students will have distributed their resumes to human resource departments researched during the Course, if they are seeking job placement after graduating.
